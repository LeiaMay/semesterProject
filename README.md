5. Export Transactions to CSV: Saves transactions to a CSV file for external use.
6. Import Transactions from CSV: Imports transactions from a CSV file into the tracker.

PROJECT SETUP
Our team used regular code reviews upon meeting to make sure we all understood the code and its functionality in addition to agreeing on how the project was being built. We actively collaborated on a regular basis so as to stay up to date on project development. 

CLEAN CODE PRINCIPLES
We applied various clean code principles to this project to reduce complexity and keep development running smoothly. We made sure to use meaningful name variables throughout the project so that each team member would have a better understanding of the code and its functionality. The Single Responsibility Principle was applied to the Transaction and Personal Finance Tracker classes. Our code also follows consisten formatting principles.
